# Characteristics of Metaverse

The metaverse allows people to immerse in any digital world and participate in any physical reality at any time irrespective of the location. The emergent properties of metaverse allow people to collaborate more flexibly at times allowing the merger of online and offline components. These properties help metaverse to grow continuously. {cite}`metamandrill_2022_metaverse`.

## No Limits or Boundaries

Some limitations are imposed on users and developers by Web 2.0 companies but the real value of the metaverse will be realized with the Web 3.0 companies in which there will be no limitations in any shape or form. The metaverse is limitless not just in terms of opportunities but it is also limitless in terms of space. The spaces where there is no access currently are not available just because nothing is built on that. They will be available once the metaverse-centered developer utilizes them. 

## No central authority in control

The virtual worlds in the metaverse can not be owned by any single company or person. Though people can own assets in these virtual worlds. The proof of ownership of different assets by the stakeholders is demonstrated by blockchain-backed systems.

## Always Active

Just like the real world, the metaverse virtual worlds can't be deactivated since it's a decentralized system with distinct independent components. The shutdown of a server can deactivate certain parts of a certain virtual world but bringing down the complete metaverse is not possible.

## Equipped with Functional Economy

The metaverse operates with its distinct economy almost completely powered by cryptocurrency. People use their cryptocurrencies to buy digital assets just like the way money is used in the real world. Artistic digital assets can be protected as non-fungible tokens (NFT).

## Potential to provide a rich immersive Sensory Experience

Various senses can be engaged while interacting with the virtual worlds. In this current state, the virtual reality goggles engage the eyes and ears. But the metaverse has the potential to engage more senses to create a rich immersive experience through various activities. One of the examples of high immersive activity will be letting people design their environment.

## Encourage real Social Connections

The metaverse has brought the social connection experience in virtual reality to a more realistic form. The experience of social interactions brings in new surprises triggering various forms of emotions and feelings. People can explore various activities which will help develop the metaverse's economy.
