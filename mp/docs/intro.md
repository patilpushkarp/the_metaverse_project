# Knowing Metaverse

## Defining Metaverse

The term metaverse was coined by Neal Stephenson in the science fiction novel 'Snow Crash' in 1992, in which he envisioned lifelike avatars who met in realistic 3D buildings and other virtual reality environments. The metaverse refers to the shift in the way people communicate using technologies in this fast-growing world {cite}`economic_times_04_2022`. There isn't any formal definition of the metaverse. Various groups define the metaverse in the manner they perceive it. The meaning of the metaverse can be flexible and can describe different experiences {cite}`metamandrill_2022_metaverse`. 
Economic times puts the metaverse as a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection and it can be defined as a simulated digital environment that uses augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and blockchain, along with concepts from digital media, to create spaces for rich user interaction mimicking the real world {cite}`economic_times_04_2022`. Mitselmakher of Bloccelerate defined the metaverse as a collection of uniquely crafted virtual worlds, designed to provide highly immersive experiences, where people, objects, and assets can interact with one another in a seamless, fully interoperable, highly composable way {cite}`mitselmakher_2021`. According to Metamandrill, the metaverse is a digital universe that exists with our physical one to create immersive, interactive and hyper-realistic experiences. It is still in its experimentation stages, constantly creating new surprises {cite}`metamandrill_2022_metaverse`. 

## Metaverse Experience

The metaverse can either be a completely virtual digital world or it can be our surroundings with a mobile digital overlay (an augmented reality approach) {cite}`metamandrill_2022_metaverse`. The development of virtual reality and augmented reality technologies accelerated the build-up of social connections virtually. These technologies are supplementing the virtual worlds and improving their adoption. The metaverse is also backed by blockchain for facilitating transactions.
